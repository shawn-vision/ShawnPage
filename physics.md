# 💨🌊 Physical Explanation and Modeling of Wind and Water Dynamics

### 🦠 Epidemiology and Fluid Mechanics

My study shows that even a small number of infected individuals who travel between communities — what we call “geographical spreaders” — can dramatically influence how a disease spreads. Using a mathematical model, we found that just 1–10% of mobile infected people can speed up the outbreak and create organized patterns like waves or hotspots in places far from the original source. 

These findings highlight that **movement** — how far and how often people travel — can be just as important as infection rates when it comes to understanding and controlling outbreaks. Even if most people stay put, a few movers can reshape the entire course of an epidemic.

###  🧱 Turbulence and the Wall

A fundamental problem in fluid mechanics is explaining **energy dissipation in turbulent flows** due to friction at boundaries (wall friction). This issue has significant implications for the transport of oil and methane across continents.

Traditional analyses rely on empirical tools such as **Nikuradse/Moody diagrams** to describe friction factor as a function of **Reynolds number** and **relative roughness**. My work derives a **first-principles physical explanation** based on turbulence theory, unifying these diagrams into a **single curve** by using the turbulence energy spectrum.

### 🌿 Turbulence and the Vegetation

This research examines how **boundary roughness** (e.g., vegetation) affects **flow structure** and bulk flow properties. 

- Developed an **asymmetric eddy diffusivity model** for vegetated flows.
- Derived a **universal velocity distribution equation** using asymptotic analysis.
- Applied numerical **reactive transport modeling** to quantify contaminant absorption by vegetation in floating treatment wetlands.

The study links **microscale physics** to **field-scale contaminant removal efficiency**, confirming results against empirical data.

###  🪸 Turbulence and Sediments

This work introduced one of the first models for **sediment settling velocity** in turbulent flows using **perturbation analysis**.

Traditionally, settling velocity is assumed equal to still water, but my work shows turbulence **reduces** settling velocity via:
- **Basset history force**
- **Virtual mass effects**

This challenges assumptions used in **Rouse's equation** and explains discrepancies with **turbulent Schmidt number** formulations. The derived **comprehensive equation** includes **all turbulence scales**, from bulk flow to **Kolmogorov scale**, revealing:
- Scaling with **Reynolds number**
- Limits of local mixing-length models
- **Rouse equation** as a special case

###  🏞️ Sediment Carrying Capacity from Turbulence Theory

Channel vulnerability to **scour and deposition** remains a key engineering concern, especially under climate pressure. Existing models often lack direct links between **sediment physics** and **observations**.

My research derives a **universal prediction formula** starting from:
- **Turbulent Kinetic Energy (TKE)** equations
- **Shear stress budget**

This formulation spans **five orders of magnitude** of historic measurements and supports:
- Climate adaptation infrastructure
- Engineering of resilient scouring/deposition systems

The model bridges **microscale turbulence** and **bulk-scale sediment transport**, enabling more reliable and physically grounded sediment predictions.
