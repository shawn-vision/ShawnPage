<h2>🔬 About Me</h2>

<p>I lead the <em>Machine Learning for Data Assimilation</em> project at <a href="https://leap.columbia.edu/">LEAP</a> — NSF’s Science and Technology Center focused on Learning the Earth with AI and Physics. At Columbia University, I am jointly mentored by Professors <a href="https://leap.columbia.edu/">Pierre Gentine</a> and <a href="https://leap.columbia.edu/">Tian Zheng</a> (Department of Statistics).</p>

<p>My research bridges <strong>physics-based modeling</strong> and <strong>machine learning</strong> to advance understanding and prediction of geophysical systems. I focus on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Developing process-based mathematical and physical models</li>
  <li>Designing generative AI algorithms for wind–water–climate dynamics</li>
  <li>Building science-aware ML applications for Earth and environmental systems</li>
</ul>

<h2>🎓 Education</h2>

<p>I earned my Ph.D. degree in <strong>Fluid Dynamics and Hydrology (on Applied Math and Statistics)</strong> from <strong>Duke University (USA)</strong> in April 2023, where I was fortunate to have been advised by Professor <a href="https://nicholas.duke.edu/people/faculty/gabriel-katul/">Gabriel "Gaby" Katul</a>, a member of the <strong>National Academy of Engineering</strong>. Additionally, I was guided by Professor <a href="https://ece.duke.edu/people/vahid-tarokh/">Vahid Tarokh</a>, also an NAE member, and obtained a Master of Science degree in <strong>Computer Science</strong> concentrated on <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong>.</p>

<p>I completed a Master’s degree in Mechanical Engineering (minor in Climate Science) at <strong>Cornell University (USA)</strong> in June 2019, following an earlier degree in Environmental Engineering Science from <strong>Northwestern University (USA)</strong>, where I graduated in May 2018—marking the beginning of my academic journey in the United States.</p>
